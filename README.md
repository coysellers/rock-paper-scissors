# rock-paper-scissors
A Rock, Paper, Scissors game built with JavaScript. This project is part of a personal effort to keep learning, set aside JS frameworks momentarily, and build more things using only Javascript.

## Details
This app is currently incomplete... :mount_fuji: :page_facing_up: :scissors:

The goal here is to:

**Get it working**

- [x] Create clickable user options
- [x] Generate a random result for the oppenent (the computer)
- [x] Compaire the two and tally a score

**Refactor**

- [ ] Restucture files and create a small build process
- [ ] Learn about and use JavaScript Classes, Importing, and Exporting to refactor
- [ ] Clean Up style (maybe use a css framework like Tailwind or Spectre.css)

**Saving Data**

- [ ] Use local storage to keep track of score and total games won.
